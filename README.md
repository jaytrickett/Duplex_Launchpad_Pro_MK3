# Duplex_Launchpad_Pro_MK3
Renoise Duplex configuration for Launchpad Pro MK3

This configuration currently allows GridPie to run in the session mode of the Launchpad Pro MK3. All other modes (Note, Chord, Custom, Sequencer) are available while in use.

The colors need some work.

Don't forget to release the device after you are done or the launchpad will remain in session mode.
It's the last menu item under Tools/Duplex.

Planned:
    Working mute, solo, volume, pan, sends, device buttons
